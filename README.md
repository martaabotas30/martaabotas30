ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marta!

ðŸ‘€ I'm absolutely stoked about delving into the mysteries of particle physics, geeking out over web development, and diving headfirst into the exhilarating world of data analysis. These passions keep me on my toes, fueling my never-ending quest for knowledge, creativity, and that 'a-ha' moment!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 as I am seeking to combine my creativity with the art of developing interactive websites :)
